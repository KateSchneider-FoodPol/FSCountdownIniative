## Including BoxPlots

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

data_indicator24 %>% ggplot(aes(WBIncome,Share)) + ylab('Proportion of people who cannot afford a healthy diet') + geom_boxplot() + geom_point()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
