```{r}
View(food_prices_cost)

#Merge data
data_indicator25 <- merge(food_prices_cost, World_Bank_Classifications, by = "Country")

#16 observations are lost when dataset is merged with the WB classifications.

```

## Including BoxPlots

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

#Changing WBIncome into WBRegion would generate the box plot for World Bank Regions.

data_indicator25 %>% ggplot(aes(WBIncome,Share)) + ylab('cost of a healthy diet (2017USD)') + geom_boxplot() + geom_point()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
