This repository contains the code for the Food Systems Countdown Report. The report is an annual publication from 2021-2030. This repository is our working code. Final code and datasets for each year's publication will be archived on Harvard Dataverse.

The code are created with RStudio and are RMarkdown files. The code currently requires the user to first download the Food Systems Dashboard data: https://foodsystemsdashboard.org/compareandanalyze. Once downloaded, modify the RMarkdown script to identify the working folder with the data. From there our script should create the working datasets for the indicators used in the Food Systems Countdown Report.
